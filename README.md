# java-mcc-zero-lv-generator
A Mutant Crawl Classics zero-level random character generator designed in the Java programming language.  The generator replicates the random dice rolling mechanics of creating a Level 0 Character found in the MCC rulebook.  A hierarchy of Class inheritance is used in this program, to reflect the principles of object-oriented programming.  An Iterator is used to store abstract method signatures, while an abstract class inherits these method signatures.  An AbilityScore class extends the abstract class, inheriting its methods.  Another class (DependantStatistic) extends the AbilityScore class using the values generated from this class.  Enumerators are used to store lists of data, which are randomly generated in the DependantStatistic class.
